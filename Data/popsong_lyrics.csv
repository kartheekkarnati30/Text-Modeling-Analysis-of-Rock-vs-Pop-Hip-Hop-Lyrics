But then I say you wanna beer, you always up for that
You always just can't get enough
And think you can handle it with just one touch
But now I better let you know
That I'm better off alone
So please think again,
Because this is the end!","Pink",16

Called me up to say ""good luck""

First date, we ate sushi and
It went well, I was funny and
You said I was a cutie

"I've never written a love song
That didn't end in tears
Maybe you'll rewrite my love song
If you can replace my fears
I need your patience and guidance
And all your lovin' and more
When thunder rolls through my life
Will you be able to weather the storm?
There's so much I would give ya, baby
If I'd only le myself
There's this well of emotions
I feel I must protect
But what's the point of this armor
If it keeps the love away, too?
I'd rather bleed with cuts of love
Than live without any scars
Baby, can I trust this?
Or do all things end?
I need to hear that you'd die for me
Again and again and again
So tell me when you look in my eyes
Can you share all the pain and happy times
'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life
This is my very first love song
That didn't end in tears
I think you re-wrote my love song
For the rest of my years
I wil love you for the rest of my Life","Pink",487

Cause she was a registered nurse and she tried to save his life
But that would go against rules and regulations
To just forget at 2 at night
We're so proud of our boys in blue
Cause they always do what's right

How does a mama tell her children their dad got killed by the police?","Pink",673

But someone called in a stolen walkman
The cops they chased him down but he refused to lie face on the ground

so I had to shoot him in the back of the head
From fifty feet away
I had to kill him it was self defense
I was afraid he would circle back around and kill me.""
I saw Corneleus speak today at the Hayward High
That other police stole his sons life away
Over a walkman that wasn't that much more than change
How does a father find justice for a son stolen away?
Stolen away
Stolen away
Stolen away
Stolen away

Around my feelings

In the 6 double O, bumpin Isley
He was gettin kinda close, kinda touch-ay
Cuz he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he wanna go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""boo, I don't really know though""
He got closer to me...it started gettin deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before

I knew that he was slick","Pink",806

Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak...his body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you
But baby
Don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh
You needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya
But baby
Don't get it twisted (don't get it twisted)
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage

"[Verse 1:]
Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you read a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last","Rihanna",1188
"[Chorus:]
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go

Now I know","Rihanna",1189
"[Verse 2:]
Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned","Rihanna",1190

"[Verse 1]
Whassup? i know we haven't spoken for a while
I was thinking bout you and it kinda made me smile
So many things to say and I'll put them in a letter
Thought it might be easier, the words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother? Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish i could press rewind and rewrite every line to the story of me and you
[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind
but it don't get no better as each day go by
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you
[verse 2]
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
there's a lot of feelings that remains since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would've it all behind me
but it seems there's always something right there to remind me
like a silly joke or something on the TV, boy it ain't easy
when I hear our song I get that same old feeling
wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time and I shouldn't be telling you
[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind
but it don't get no better as each day go by
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you
(you, still not over you)
[verse 3]
Did you know I've kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oooh nooo.. tried to erase
The way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
[chorus]
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind
but it don't get no better as each day go by
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you
Still not over you, see I've tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried, I've tried to get you off my mind
but it don't get no better as each day go by
and I'm lost and confuse I've got nothing to lose
hope to hear from you soon... P.S I'm still not over you

Talk about an example of a shorty that might need to prowla
Got a chick in the bug, it come with a little shoppahora
Take you to the Caribbean down the Carolina
To the Mediterranean and enjoy the water

That you was using me
In a different way
That I was using you

Just like everything you told me
When we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's till the day that we die
Boy, you forget about the promises
Made me, and now I let the memories
Fade away, but I rememeber what
You used to say
When we ride...
I remember what ya used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's till the day that we die..
We ride..when we ride, we ride
It's till the day that we die..","Rihanna",1628

Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)

To places I have never been

Cram it all down my throat

Already in a spin

Nobody's lookin' but everybody's talkin'

'Coz what if I never love again?","Adele",2831
"Wait
Do you see my heart on my sleeve
It's been there for days on end and it's been waiting for you to open up
Just you baby
Come on now
I'm trying to tell you
Just how I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me","Adele",2832
"That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more

But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you","Adele",2833
"You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This isn't a routine
With you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me
Yeah","Adele",2834
"Why is it everytime I think I've tried my hardest it turns out it ain't enough
'Cause you're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say","Adele",2835
"I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and you never want more

"But despite the truth that I know I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I find myself with you ","Adele",2839
"And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh","Adele",2840
"I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further

'cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you","Adele",2842

So where you been then
Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault","Adele",2848

The one that shoots me each and every time","Adele",2849

Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her","Adele",2850

You make it look like I'm see through

"Daydreamer
Sittin' on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Makin' up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt
Her figure before
Jaw dropper
Looks good
When he when he walks
He is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands
Behind his back, oh","Adele",2865
"You can find him sittin'
On your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like
He's been there for hours
And you can tell
That he'll be there for life","Adele",2866
"Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
And then sees you through
There's no way
I could describe him
All I say is
Just what I'm hoping for","Adele",2867
"But I will find him
Sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel
Like he's been
There for hours
And I can tell
He'll be there for life
And I can tell
He'll be there for life","Adele",2868

You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any thing,
I had no idea of the state we were in","Adele",2869

And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head...","Adele",2870

Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more","Adele",2871

The more I do, the less I know","Adele",2872

I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me","Adele",2875

Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more","Adele",2876
"When will I see you again?","Adele",2877
"So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face
The one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry","Adele",2878
"Forgive me first love but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply it's tiring","Adele",2879
"This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new","Adele",2880

I'm bored to say the least and I
I lack desire","Adele",2881

"Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone","Adele",2883
"But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk","Adele",2884
"So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead","Adele",2885
"But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own

I am willing to take the risk","Adele",2886
"There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart, then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust, but nothing will ever taint us","Adele",2887

I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go

I am willing to take the risk","Adele",2888
"Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late","Adele",2889
"He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go

"Hello, it's me, I was wondering
If after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal, yeah
But I ain't done much healing","Adele",2892

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet","Adele",2893

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home","Adele",2895

At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore","Adele",2896
"Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?","Adele",2897
"It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time","Adele",2898

"This is how the story went:
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And it was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away","Adele",2904
"I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away","Adele",2905
"Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
And watched you wave, and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home","Adele",2906
"I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Away, yeah...","Adele",2907
"Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home","Adele",2908
"I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day

"I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel
And strutting my feet
""Is there anything I can do for you dear
Is there anyone I can call""
""No and thank you
Please Madam
I ain't lost
Just wandering""","Adele",2910

I love to see everybody in short skirts
Shorts and shades

"I thought I told you he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer in here
Like a fool for fire I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees","Adele",2921
"But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river, I cried
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you","Adele",2922
"So, you thought that I would crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, will you leave your man?
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you","Adele",2923
"'Cause I found a boy who I love more

Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river, you'll cry
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you","Adele",2926

 I want your heaven and your oceans too

 And kiss me back to life to see
 Your body standing over me","Adele",2927

 Towards me from across the room
 Brushing past my every groove

 But be delicate with my ego
 I wanna step into your great unknown
 With you and me setting the tone","Adele",2930

(1st Verse)
People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a christian
I ain't a muslim, ain't a jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord'll follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggaz looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
when niggaz ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend","John Legend",3135
"(Chorus)
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain

"These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guys like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way","John Legend",3137

Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I hit you with the best stroke,
freestyle and the breast stroke
'Til you're blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?

Work it out then we cool down, cool down

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)
Listen, you ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you, we got that mental telepathy
Meet me up in the spot, I'll be sendin' over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread stay poppin' up like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, we'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form
Hibernate under my body, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flyin' my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on the grill 'cause seven days a week you're my five course meal, forreal
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had

Know what I mean, know what I'm saying, know what I'm talking about, girl who is playing?
But we can't have no picket fence 'cause we got acres and acres of land
The haters are taking it mad
That we can handle these fakers with class
Mannerisms on that C.O. five and a half on they ass
Girl, bye, give it a try, give your boy a chance
Ever since you landed in my space it seems like I'm yours again
My top friend, drop them
We don't need no audience
Popping
For approval or applause, not them","Chris Brown",4599

"[Verse 1:]
Hey mama have you seen a chic
Whos body's 'bout as good as it gets
Oh yeah this cutie was thick
I ain't never seen a girl like this
With so much class and so much hips
Got me feeling right
And I ain't worried about the things she do
Cuz she the type that don't need a crew
And I can tell it by the way she smiles
Swagga's bad, can't be mad
Let's get close tonight","Chris Brown",5120
"[Chorus:]
The craziest body
Exotic little mami
She got curves in the back
Sexy eyes to match
What's messing with that?
Her smile lights up the room
And she ain't got no attitude
I wouldn't say if it wasn't true
I'm talking about you","Chris Brown",5121

So baby now you know the deal
Don't be frontin tell a nigga what's real
Come on baby tell me how you feel

Don't get it twisted cuz babygirl you know I want it
And I know you really wanna be my woman
Girl, I'm talking about you","Chris Brown",5122

Me and you know what the deal is","Chris Brown",5128
"Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love
