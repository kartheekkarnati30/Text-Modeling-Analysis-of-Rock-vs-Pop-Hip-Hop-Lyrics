"On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally ran aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you","Pink Floyd"
"Not life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey","Pink Floyd"
"I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away...slipped away","Pink Floyd"

"A cloud of eider down
Draws around me softening the sound
Sleepy time in my life
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And the candle dies.
When night comes down you lock the door
The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is raw.
Now wakes the hour that sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields
A cold rain is falling
Near the golden dawn.
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds and I go down
Sleepy time in our life
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird
In the haze and the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die.","Pink Floyd"
"Bath of tequila, Manuel
Leaf and cringle
Laugh at my lisp and kill you
I think
This Spanish music
It sets my soul on fire
Lovely seniorita
Your eyes are like stars
Your teeth are like pearls
Your ruby lips seniorita","Pink Floyd"

"Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket

Resting my mind
And I'll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin' from nine to five.
And if you don't mind

In the warm light and the love in her eyes.

"I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I know a room of musical tunes.
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.

"The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon","Pink Floyd"
"I can't think of anything to say except...
I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!","Pink Floyd"
"Home, home again
I like to be there when I can
When I come in cold and tired

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell

To hear the softly spoken magic spells.","Pink Floyd"

"Bridges burning gladly,
Merging with the shadows,
Flickering between the lines.
Stolen moments floating softly on the air,
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher.
Ancient bonds are breaking,
Moving on and changing sides.
Dreaming of a new day,
Cast aside the other way.
Magic visions stirring,
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes.
The door stands ajar,
The wall that once were high.
Beyond the gilded cage,
Beyond the reach of ties.
The moment is at hand.
She breaks the golden band.","Pink Floyd"

Please you know I'm feeling frail","Pink Floyd"

"A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return.
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one.
Change returns success
Going and coming without error.
Action brings good fortune.
Sunset.
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come.
Thunder in the other course of heaven.
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all.
Change returns success
Going and coming without error.
Action brings good fortune.
Sunset, sunrise.
A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return.

"You shout in your sleep.
Perhaps the price is just too stepp.
Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?
You awake with a start to just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.
You set sail across the sea of longpast thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end,
Your fantasies merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice.
Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?
Some are born;
Some men die beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But everything one day will cease.
All the iron turned to rust;
All the proud men turned to dust.
And so all things, time will mend.
So this song will end.","Pink Floyd"
"In a churchyard by a river,
Lazing in the haze of midday,
Laughing in the grasses and the graze.
Yellow bird, you are alone in singing and in flying on,
In and in leaving. Willow weeping in the water,
Waving to the river daughters,
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds.
On a trip to Cirrus Minor, saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later.","Pink Floyd"
"Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro?
You have no word
Trip, trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
Was cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong
Coughs and clears his throat
Madam you see before you stand
Hey ho, never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green herbarian band
And the tune they play is ""in us confide""
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro?
You have no word
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!","Pink Floyd"
"Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed...
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
They'll never put me in their bag
The raging seas will always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always squeak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!","Pink Floyd"
"Sit up, touching hips
To a madcap galloping chase
""cheat"" he cried shouting kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Hey ho, huff the talbot","Pink Floyd"

"Hello,
Is there anybody out there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home
come on now,
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?","Pink Floyd"
"There is no pain you are receding
a distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more hurting
But you may feel a little sick
can you stand up?
I do believe its working good
that'll keep you going through the show
Come on its time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become
Comfortably numb","Pink Floyd"
"Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of lifeand the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life","Pink Floyd"
"I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight..into the shining sun","Pink Floyd"
"Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war, in 1944.

It's high time

Please wake me Butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in there's no where you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling colored photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time
Cymbaline
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
The lines converging where you stand they must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet you hear the thunder of the train

"You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, alone
Dragged down by the stone.
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everythings done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone.","Pink Floyd"
"Ooooh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road.
Remember the flowers I sent.
I need you, Babe,
To put through the shredder in front of my friends.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you,
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How can you treat me this way?
Running away.
Oh Babe,
Why are you running away?","Pink Floyd"
"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and
Something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to the land
And no one crosses there alive
And no one speaks
And no one tries
And no one flies around the sun
And now this is the day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Comes streamin in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky.","Pink Floyd"

"All around
I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear.
Red the light
And dark the night
I feel my dawn is near.
Warm glow,
Moon glow,
Always need a little more room.
Whisper low
Here I go,
I will see the sunshine show.","Pink Floyd"
"When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Summer's thunder time of year,
The sound of music in my ears.
Distant bells,
New mown grass smells so sweet.
By the river holding hands,
Roll me up and lay me down.
And if you sit,
Don't make a sound.
Pick your feet up off the ground.
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange,
Sing to me, sing to me.
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Children's laughter in my ears,
The last sunlight disappears.
And if you sit,
Don't make a sound.
Pick your feet up off the ground.
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange,
Sing to me, sing to me.
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Children's laughter in my ears,
The last sunlight disappears.","Pink Floyd"
"You say the hill's too steep to climb,
Climb it!
You say you'd like to see me try,
Climb it!
You pick the place and I'll choose the time
And I'll climb
The hill in my own way
just wait a while, for the right day
And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds
I look down hear the sound of the things you said today
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling
Emotionless the magistrate turns 'round, frowning
and who's the fool who wears the crown
Go down in your own way
And everyday is the right day
And as you rise above the fearlines in the frown
You look down
Hear the sound of the faces in the crowd","Pink Floyd"
"Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown.
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you.
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn.
No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you.
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion.
Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might.
Screaming through the starlit sky
Travelling by telephone.
Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high.
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown.
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you.","Pink Floyd"
"The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You suffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself till you die.
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest.
You get your chance to try
In the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less.
So all aboard for the American tour,
And maybe you'll make it to the top.
And mind how you go.
I can tell you, because I know.
You may find it hard to get off.
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son.
And he died like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still in the run.
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You suffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself till you die.","Pink Floyd"

Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

"Icy wind of night, be gome.
This is not your domain.
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.
In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes settle on the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.

"Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine beat her blind everytime
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Many is the bond between the hopefull and the damned","Pink Floyd"

memories come rushing up to meet me now
in the space between the heavens
and in the corner of some foreign field
i had a dream
i had a dream
goodbye max
goodbye ma
after the service when you're walking slowly to the car
and the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air
you hear the tolling bell
and touch the silk in your lapel
and as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
you take her frail hand
and hold on to the dream
a place to stay
enough to eat
somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
where you can speak out loud
about your doubts and fears
and what's more no-one ever disappears
you never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
you can relax on both sides of the tracks
and maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
and everyone has recourse to the law
and no-one kills the children anymore
and no-one kills the children anymore
night after night
going round and round my brain
his dream is driving me insane
in the corner of some foreign field
the gunner sleeps tonight
what's done is done
we cannot just write off his final scene
take heed of the dream
take heed","Pink Floyd"

Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me
Hey you ! Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me
Hey you ! don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight.
Hey you ! out there on your own
sitting naked by the phone would you touch me
Hey you ! with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me
Hey you ! would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only a fantasy
The wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain.
Hey you ! out there on the road
Doing what you're told, can you help me
Hey you ! out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me
Hey you ! don't tell me there's no hope at all

Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head

And brought me here instead dressed in red

Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to guide my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, A state of bliss
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time.
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning.

The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy sories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by.

And I've got the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt

I've got wild staring eyes

They'll never put me in their bag

Our love turns gray,
Like the skin on a dying man.

And nothing is very much fun, anymore.

Cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left,
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened,
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.

Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate a silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?

"A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to life
One regret, you will never forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

banging your heart against some mad buggers

Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away - away - away - away - away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do - I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away - away - away - away - away
Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be

fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
laughing too loud at the rest of the world

Slide a rind down behind
the sofa in San Tropez
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
Riding a wave in the wake of an old Sedan
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from our love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling
If you're alone I'll come home
Backwards and home bound
The pidgeon the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Owning a home with no silver spoon
I'm drinking champaigne like a big tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day
If your alone I'll come home
And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to things they say
Digging for gold in the hoe in my hand
Hoping they'll take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
if you're alone I'll come home","Pink Floyd"

The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind,
is calling sailors to the deep
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
Surf is high an' the sea is awash
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun
That was hot to touch
And the sea was emerald green
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
And I can see you smile
Surf comes rushing up the beach
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
Catfish dappled silver flashing
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep","Pink Floyd"

Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't know so then
She goes up while he goes down, down

A brother's way to leave

Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Novices lean on each other in yearning
Under the leaves the swallow is resting

One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripen's the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Making the shape of his question to heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving

with her handkerchief
and her summer frock clings

white upon the slippery reins

Surprised to find you by my side.

The music was too loud.
From your bed I came today and lost a bloody year.
And I would like to know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
Not a single word was said.
They lied still without fears.
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon in a wind of ninetyfive.
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish I was there.
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you.
Have you time before you leave to greet another man
Just to let me know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?
Goodbye to you.
Childish bangles too.
I've had enough for one day.","Pink Floyd"

Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.

A blue green hood,
It looked quite good.
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last.
Wining, dining, biding his time.
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Hoooooooooray.
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river

Winding, finding places to go.

Going always where she pleases.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today

No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time

and you'll never hear their voices
and you'll never see their faces
you have no recourse to the law anymore
and as the windshield melts
my tears evaporate
leaving only charcoal to defend
finally i understand
the feelings of the few
ashes and diamonds
foe and friend
we were all equal in the end","Pink Floyd"
"Us and them
and after all we're only ordinary men

moved from side to side","Pink Floyd"
"Black and blue
and who knows which is which and who is who
up and down

there's room for you inside","Pink Floyd"
"Down and out
it can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
with, without

for want of the price of tea and a slice
the old man died","Pink Floyd"
"In yellow shoes I get the blues
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man how are you?
So I've changed my dear, and I find my knees,
And I covered them up with the latest cut,
And my pants and socks all point in a box,
They don't make long of my nylon socks,
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole,
And all the lot is what I got,
It's what I wear, it's what you see,
It must be me, it's what I am,
Vegetable man.","Pink Floyd"

Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do ?","Pink Floyd"
"Ooooh you cannot reach me now
Ooooh no matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world it's over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers v And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons
And the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again my friend
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again my friend
All you need to do is follow the worms.","Pink Floyd"
"From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognize I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word...overrun
Won't hear a sound
From my mouth
I've spent too long
On the inside out
My skin is cold
To the human touch
This bleeding heart's
Not beating much","Pink Floyd"
"I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile","Pink Floyd"

I'm wearing the inside out","Pink Floyd"

He's paler somehow
But he's coming round
He's starting to choke

Well he can have the words right from my mouth","Pink Floyd"

Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again","Pink Floyd"

For the day

Have blown away
I'm with you now
Can speak your name

"Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,
provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,
So welcome to the machine.
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.
So welcome to the machine.","Pink Floyd"
"As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears
What do you want
What do you want from me
Should I sing until I can't sing any more
Play these strings until my fingers are raw
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me
Do you think that I know something you don't know
What do you want from me
If I don't promise you the answers would you go
What do you want from me
Should I stand out in the rain
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you
I'm not the one you need
What do you want from me","Pink Floyd"

Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across the sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the east?
contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure?
Store up leisure?

With our backs to the wall.","Pink Floyd"
"It was just before dawn
One miserable morning in black 'forty four.
When the forward commander
Was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn.
And the Generals gave thanks
As the other ranks held back
The enemy tanks for a while.
And the Anzio bridgehead
Was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.","Pink Floyd"
"And old King George
Sent Mother a note
When he heard that father was gone.
It was, I recall,
In the form of a scroll,
With gold leaf and all.
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away.
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp.","Pink Floyd"
"It was dark all around.
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free.

From the Royal Fusiliers Company C.

Most of them dead,
The rest of them dying.
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me.","Pink Floyd"

blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?","Pink Floyd"
"And did they get you trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cold breeze?
Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange
a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?","Pink Floyd"

We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,

"Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation,
The pack in formation
Bowling they bat as a group
And the leader is seen - so early...
The pack on their backs, the fighters
Through misty the waving - the pack in formation
Far reaching waves
On sight, shone right
I lay as if in surround...
All enmeshing, hovering...
The milder I gaze
All the animals laying trail
Beyond the bough winds
Mild the reflecting electricity eyes...
Tears, the life that was ours
Grows sharper and stronger away and beyond
Short wheeling - fresh spring
Gripped with blanched bones - moaned
Magnesium, proverbs and sobs...
Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation,
The pack in formation...","Pink Floyd"

Looks allright from where I stand
Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it's time
To let me in from the cold
Turn my land into gold
Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Flash the red is wots...uh the deal
Got to make to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel.
Mile after mile
Stone after stone
Turn to speak but you're alone
A million miles from home - you're on your own
So let me in from the cold
Turn my land into gold
Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Fly bright by candlelight
Up out of my sight
And if she prefers we will never stir again
Someone said the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout 'come on in, what's the news and where've you been?'
Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old","Pink Floyd"

some brighteyed and crazy some frightened and lost
a warning to anyone still in command
of their possible future to take care

with cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time

do you thing we should be closer?
she stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile
haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
for the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
stepping up boldly one put out his hand
he said,  i was just a child then now i'm only a man
do you remember me? how we used to be?
do you thing we should be closer?
by the cold and religious we were taken in hand
shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay
and strung out behind us the banners and flags
of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags

do you thing we should be closer?","Pink Floyd"

To jeopardize the course, upset the run;
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun.","Led Zeppelin"
"Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast,
Unending dances shadowed on the day.
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep,
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay.
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep,
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray;
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed,
But no one seemed to question in anyway.","Led Zeppelin"
"How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak;
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep.
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow.
Dull is the armour, cold is the day.
Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way.
I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh.
I couldn't stand it another day, another day,
Another day, another day.","Led Zeppelin"
"Touched by the timely coming,
Roused from the keeper's sleep,

Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.

The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.","Led Zeppelin"

Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.","Led Zeppelin"

Touching you like a sickness
Fear is taking control,
The beach head is the street.
In the gutter lies defeat.

That makes you dangerous
So dangerous to yourself

Watching you, touching you,
Can you feel it in the shadows?
Watching you, touching you
Changing you into a mad dog.
Howling at the moon.
And you're so far out of tune

She knows all the charts, breaks her heart, thinks a lot of you,
Each time you play a melody, it means the earth to this little girl,
Can you be cruel and break her heart, tear her small world apart.
She's there, eyes aglow, very front row, don't throw sticks at her,
Please don't look her way, see her way, don't care anyway.","The Who"

Lots of Woolworth's makeup, a pair of Black Watch trews,

You must really have something
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away
Important to say","The Who"

And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean

Then you can be sure, you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write","The Who"

To bring her some money, she's calling you ""honey""

He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man

And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied","The Who"

"[Roger's theme]
When a man is running from his boss
Who hold a gun that fires ""cost""
And people die from being cold
Or left alone because they're old
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And children's dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers
No one can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
But only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong...","The Who"

And although he may think we are broken,
We'll get up and take two steps more.","The Who"

"Saw a man about fifty or so
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practacally froze when I spoke
But eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet","The Who"
"With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said ""I know there's no name
For what you go through
But how can you do it alone.""","The Who"
"I crossed the street to the local newstore
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some schoolkid I saw
Push some girlie mags down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
Asked me to call for the police.
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets.","The Who"
"With eyes full of shame [etc.]","The Who"

"How can you do it.","The Who"
"Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And wasn't too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans.","The Who"

And I know it must show
I slump - and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
How can you do it alone.","The Who"

There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past
He buys me a brandy

But no-one else ever stares, he's being so kind
What's the reason?","The Who"

And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out
Everybody hears me
But I look like a fool now

Now I think I've reached the end
I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate?","The Who"

Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you","The Who"

"When I first signed a contract
It was more than a handshake then
I know it still is
But there's a plain fact
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs
I get the willies
People know nothing about their own soft gut
So how come they can sum us up
Without suffering all the hype we've known
How come they bum us up","The Who"

"I see myself on T.V., I'm a faker, a paper clown
It's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie; I just bring them down
I claim proneness to exaggeration
But the truth lies in my frustration
The children of the night, they all pass me by
Have to drench myself in brandy
In sleep I'll hide
But however much I booze
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
I don't care what you say, boy
There ain't no way out","The Who"
"I lose so many nights of sleep worrying about my responsibilities
Are the problems that screw me up really down to him or me
My ego will just confuse me
Some day it's going to up and use me

And however much I squirm
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out

There ain't no way out","The Who"
"Won't somebody tell me how to get out of this place?!","The Who"
"Then the night comes down like a cell door closing
Suddenly I realize that I'm right now, I'm on the scene
While sitting here all alone with a bottle and my head a-floating
Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me
And on at me, and I don't care what you say
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out","The Who"
"Now the walls are all clawed and scratched
Like by some soul insane
In the morning I hung-overly detach myself
I take no blame
I just can't face my failure
I'm nothing but a well fucked sailor
You at home can easily decide what's right
By glancing very briefly at the songs I write
But it don't help me that you know
This ain't no way out
Won't somebody tell me?
I don't care what you say, boy
There ain't no way out","The Who"

I'M FREE-I'm free,
And freedom tastes of reality,
I'm free-I'm free,
AN' I'm waiting for you to follow me.
If I told you what it takes
to reach the highest high,
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

That stretched as far as the eye can see

We're having a lovely time, wish you were here
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here

"There once was a note, pure and easy,
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by.
The note is eternal, I hear it, it sees me,
Forever we blend it, forever we die.
I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar,
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star.","The Who"
"As people assemble,
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die,
But killing is really merely scene changer,
All men are bored with other men's lies.","The Who"

The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,

Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness,
The note that began all can also destroy.","The Who"
"We all know success when we all find our own dreams,
And our love is enough to knock down any walls,
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,
The simple secret of the note in us all.","The Who"

After such a love as this","The Who"

"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
that Sally couldn't go to the meeting.
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
and she ran inside weeping.
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
of the new Messiah.
She picked up a book of her fathers life
and threw it on the fire!
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.","The Who"
"The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
and sneak out anyway!
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
and decided she'd try to touch him,
Maybe he'd see that she was free
and talk to her this Sunday.","The Who"

Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

to gospel music by nine.
Group after group appeared on the stage
and Sally just sat there crying.
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
ran on and said 'here we go!'","The Who"
"The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage!
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!","The Who"
"But soon the atmosphere was cooler
as Tommy gave a lesson.
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
and leapt up on the rostrum!
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
and touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man,
threw her of the stage.","The Who"
"She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
mingling with her tears,
Tommy carried on preaching
and his voice filled Sally's ear
She caught his eye she had to try
but couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
had to carry her out that night.","The Who"
"The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face! OOoooh.","The Who"
"Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
'don't say I didn't warn yer'.
Sally got married to a rock musician
she met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
the disciples all went wild!
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
to remind her of his smile.","The Who"

Go on and tell me when the boys get here.
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock,

And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots with a handful of grease in her hair.","The Who"

I may use a little muscle to get what I need, and sink a little drink and shout out, ""She's with me!"".","The Who"

Nothing ever goes as planned,
I just couldn't face going home
It was just a drag on my own.
They finally threw me out
My mother got drunk on stout,
My dad couldn't stand on two feet,
As he lectured about morality.
Now I guess the families complete,
With me hanging round on the street
Or here on the beach.
The girl I love
Is a perfect dresser,
Wears every fashion
Gets it to the tee.
Heavens above,
I got to match her
She knows just how
She wants her man to be
Leave it to me.","The Who"

Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat

Across the ballroom
UV light making starshine
Of her smile.
I am the face,
She has to know me,
I'm dressed up better than anyone
Within a mile.","The Who"

Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.

Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you near
I'm feeling so high with you here.

Deserted rock and roll
To try to save his soul
Saturday night, gotta gig with the band

Amended his decision to the new religion","The Who"

"When I was a baby I hadn't a care in the world,
But now I'm a man, my troubles fill my head,
When I was five it was good to be alive,
But now I'm a man, I wish that I were dead.
My how time rushes by,
The moment you're born you start to die,
Time waits for no man,
And your life's spent, it's over before you begin.","The Who"
"As I sit here at my window,
My life comes back to me,
It's been so long since the good days,
It's been so long.","The Who"
"And I count up all the wasted years,
The hopes and the fears,
The laughs and the tears,
And I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what went wrong.","The Who"
"When I was a boy I had the mind of a boy,
But now I'm a man, ain't got no mind at all,
When I was in my teens I had my share of dreams,
But now I'm a man, ain't got no dreams at all.","The Who"

"Whiskey Man's my friend, he's with me nearly all the time
He always joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine","The Who"
"Nobody has ever seen him, I'm the only one
Seemingly I must be mad, Insanity is fun
If that's the way it's done
Doctors say he just a figment of my twisted mind
If they can't see my Whiskey Man they must be going blind","The Who"
"Two men dressed in white collected me two days ago
They said there's only room for one and Whiskey Man can't go","The Who"
"Whiskey Man will waste away if he's left on his own
I can't even ring him 'cause he isn't on the phone
Hasn't got a home","The Who"

It's a shame there wasn't room for Whiskey Man as well","The Who"

A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""","The Who"

Back to the Rollin' Pin

After such a love as this?","The Who"
"[chorus]","The Who"
"The streets of the future littered with remains
Of both the fools and the so called brains
The whole prediction is enough to kill
But only God knows if it won't or it will
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
Some silly creature said we'd never crack
Most would just survive and then bounce back
But the rest are crying ""Why'd I fall for that crap""
Why did I fall for that?","The Who"
"So many rash promises sincerly made
By people who believed that we were being saved
They made us all believe that we were acting white
But the truth is we've forgotten how we used to fight
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We're impotent and neutered like whining cats
We've found the piper but we've lost the rats
But the kids are crying ""Why'd I fall for that dad?""
Why did you fall?","The Who"
"It never rains under my umbrella","The Who"
"Four minutes to midnight on a sunny day
Maybe if we smile the clock'll fade away
Maybe we can force the hands to just reverse
Maybe a word, maybe maybe is a curse
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We've never been taught to fight or to face up to facts
We simply believe that we'd remain intact
But history is asking why did you fall for that
Why did you fall?","The Who"
"Why did I fall for that
Why did I fall for that
Why did I fall for that","The Who"
"We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgement of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again","The Who"
"The change, it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war","The Who"
"I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution

No, no!","The Who"
"I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?","The Who"
"There's nothing in the streets
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Are now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight","The Who"
"I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray

Don't get fooled again
No, no!","The Who"

"You - you're wasting my time
We're making music we're doing fine
Then a slap in the face takes me back to the starting line
You - your wasting my life
You can't lose what you've already lost
Your arms are open but your legs are crossed
Save me - save me
I'm going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me my next line","The Who"
"Too hot for me to handle
So cold I'm getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping
Maybe it's only a nightmare","The Who"

Of all those girls I had to choose
You win and I lose
You - you with the poisonous eyes
One look and I'm hooked
One touch and my goose is cooked","The Who"

I'm going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a life line","The Who"

Too late you've got no chance

You lead me on like a lamb to the slaughter
Then you act like a fish out of water
You - there's a name for girls like you
You've coming on like a steam train
Then you blow me away just like a hurricane","The Who"
"Save me - save me
I'm going down for the last time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a lifeline
Save me I'm falling
From the top of the page to the next line

From tips of my toes to my hairline","The Who"

So cold I'm getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping

"I call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes.
I sometimes thing I should just go home but I'm dealing with a memory

I love to hear you say my name especially when you say yes

sound of old T-Rex
To the sound of old T-Rex - who's next?","The Who"
"[Chorus:]","The Who"
"When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life

I'm not into your passport picture I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs","The Who"
"I don't really mind how much you love me
A little is really alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight","The Who"
"[Chorus: (as above)]","The Who"
"I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying ""you better""
You better bet your life","The Who"

You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now.","The Who"

I'm the snappiest dresser right down to my inch wide tie,
And to get you wise I'll explain it to you,
A few of the things that a face is supposed to do.
I wear zoot suit jacket with side vents five inches long,
I have two-tone ????? yeah you know this is wrong.
But the main thing is unless you're a fool,
Ah you know you gotta know, yeah you know, yeah you gotta be cool.","The Who"

So you keep on singing for the sake of the song

And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of lovin' at all, well","Eagles"

He kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see

He wants to dance, oh yeah,
He wants to sing, oh yeah,
He wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen
to the thunder ring","Eagles"
"He saw it in a window
The mark of a new kind of man
He kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt if,
He knew he could stand with the best","Eagles"

I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove

believe we could chug all night
On the day that I die, well
I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
Ill be alive in a dream
You better listen to me baby
Cause you know that I'm hung on you
till I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do
I do believe we chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove is right
You're so much woman I believe
we could chug all night
No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo

We're gonna do a little chugging
We're gonna do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?

You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the Queen of Diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the Queen of Hearts is always your best bet
Now, it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late","Eagles"
"The queen of diamonds let you down,
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And it' fin'lly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust

Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow

"The queen of diamonds let you down,
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And it' fin'lly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust
(Maybe tomorrow)
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Desperado
Desperado","Eagles"
"Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
""All you blood -thirsty bystanders, will you try to
find your seats?""
Watch 'em duelin'

High or low ,it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain","Eagles"

Sooner or later we all have to die?

Four men ride out and only three ride back","Eagles"
"Early in the morning
about the break of day
the earlybird is working
so his life don't fade away
spends his life denying that
he's got no time for flying
in the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
and he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
the going's getting tough
time is passing by him and he just
can't get enough
He'll tell you all is well when
all is really going wrong
the Earlybird will wake one day
and find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
and sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
and puts my mind at ease to
know that I don't harm a soul
in doing what I please
aaahhhh, ahhhh , ahhhhh ahhh.....
Any old day you say,
ain't gonna fade away
any old day you say,
ain't gonna fade away","Eagles"

"I know you need a friend
Someone you can talk to
Who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love
There's no easy answer
Only you can say what you're gonna do
I heard you on the phone
You took his number
Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy,
The guy who left you cryin'?
Isn't he the one who made you blue?
When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you've gotta make up your mind","Eagles"
"Chorus
Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you going back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above","Eagles"
"Instrumental bridge","Eagles"
"What you gonna say when he comes over
There's no easy way to see this through

Wanted to bring the year in right
Woke up this morning I don't know how
Last night I was a happy man, but the way I feel right now
It's gonna be a FUNKY NEW YEAR
FUNKY NEW YEAR
Ooo, Ahh, got to be a FUNKY NEW YEAR
FUNKY NEW YEAR
Can't remember when I ever felt worse

"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...","Eagles"

I wish you the strength to let love go on.","Eagles"
"Somewhere out there on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be somethin' better
but there's nowhere else in sight

City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

With my back against the wall

Learn to be still","Eagles"
"We are like sheep without a shepherd
We don't know how to be alone
So we wander 'round this desert

Meets a violent farewell-
Learn to be still
Learn to be still","Eagles"

They don't smell so sweet
Maybe you've forgotten
The heaven lying at your feet","Eagles"

And someday you will-

Learn to be still","Eagles"

He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransome in the heart
of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude

in the race","Eagles"

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be","Eagles"

Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you faraway
Love is here tonight
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?","Eagles"
"Tell me the truth, how do you feel?
Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all tryin' to get along
With ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along 'til they turn out the lights
There's nothin' we can do to fight it","Eagles"

He's sing for the people and people would cry

You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes","Eagles"

Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home","Eagles"

We who must remain go on laughing just the same","Eagles"
"There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar.
Great expectations, everybody's watching you.
People you meet they all seem to know you,
even your old friends treat you like you're something new.
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town,
everybody loves you, so don't let them down.
You look in her eyes, the music begins to play.
Hopeless romantics, here we go again.
But after a while you're looking the other way.
It's those restless hearts that never mend.
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town,
will she still love you when you're not around?
There's so many things you should have told her
but night after night you're willing to hold her,
just hold her tears on your shoulder.
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
that it doesn't really matter which side you're on.
You're walking away and they're talking behind you.
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along.
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town.
Everybody loves him, don't they? Now he's holding her
and you're still around, oh my my.
There's a new kid in town,
just another new kid in town.
Oo-hoo, everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town.
Oo-hoo, everybody's walking like the new kid in town.
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN I don't want to hear it
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN I don't want to hear it
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN everybody's talking
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN people started walking
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN
THERE'S A NEW KID IN TOWN (repeat   fade)

"Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
in the morning","Eagles"
"He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfold
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world

Next day they're gone","Eagles"
"I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""","Eagles"
"What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere

Coming my way down along that devastation

I'm hanging on to my special friend
the apple of my eye

my soul and she knows just what to do

You got down and did the gator, and half
an hour later, you were barfin' all over your
Girlfriend's shoes.
But the Greeks don't want no freaks.
The Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy
cheeks,
'Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks.
(GATOR!!)
She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned.
She was perfect little sister until somebody missed
her and they found her in the bushes with
the boys in the band

The Greeks don't want no freaks","Eagles"

"I got the call today, that I didn't wanna? hear
But I knew that it would come
Old true friend of ours was talking on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck,
And struggles we went through
How I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw of our contentment
And beg for something more?","Eagles"
"I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
And the more I know, less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore","Eagles"
"All these times are so uncertain
Though the yearning undefined
And then people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that leads to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Our pride and competition
Can not fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm","Eagles"
"I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you baby
And the more I know, less I understand

And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness

Even if, even if you don't love me anymore","Eagles"

"Out in the shiny night the rain was
softly falling
The tracks that ran down the boulevard
had all been washed away
Out of the silver light the past came
softly calling
And I remembered the times we spent
Inside the Sad Cafe
Oh, it seemed like a holy place
Protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud
The things we could not say
We thought we could change this world
With words like  love  and  freedom
We were part of the lonely crowd
Inside the Sad Cafe
Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore
in the sweet by and by
Some of their dreams came true
Some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind
Inside the Sad Cafe
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't
stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by
And wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some
And lets the rest go free
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very
slowly if they ever change at all
There's no use in asking why
It just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight, baby
Inside the Sad Cafe
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby
Inside the Sad Cafe","Eagles"

You might have somethin' to loose.

there's a train leaves here this morning, and
I don't know, what I might be on
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would
all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
when there wasn't something more to blame it on
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on
There's a train leaves here this morning

Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big
You know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home
I said nice boys
Don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy!","Guns n Roses"
"Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price layin' flat on her back

Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made","Guns n Roses"

You know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home","Guns n Roses"

"The following is a true story, only the names have
been changed to protect the guilty -
Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothings gonna stop us - no nothing
So if you got the money
We got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you got the dollar
We got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long,
Yeh boogie
I've got holes in my shoes
I've got holes in my teeth
I've got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million -
And I've got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean -
And I've got a Mama whose a hummer
Whose keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5 (knows her place that woman)
Just you wait -
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
And my bottle of booze (no summer time blues)
Shouting out 'look at me'
In my rock 'n' roll voice
No it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire

Up you win, down you lose
It's anybody's game

Open to charity
Rock 'n' roller welfare
Sitting in my Cadillac
Listening to my radio
Suzy baby get on in
Tell me where she want to go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline
CHORUS:
I've got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues
Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hiding from the rent man
Oh it makes me want to cry
Sheriff knocking on my door
Ain't it funny how the time flies
Sitting on my sailing boat
Sipping off my champaign
Suzy baby all at sea
Say she want to come again
Feeling like a paper cup
Floating down a storm drain
Got myself a sailing boat
But I can't afford a drop of rain

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down, fools me around
What's she doing to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs love, smells out a man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer, licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Spends my money, drinks my booze, stays out every night
And I got to thinking, ""Hey, just a minute, something ain't right""
Disillusions and confusion
Make me want to cry
All the same, you lead your games
Tellin' me your lies
Don't mind her playing a demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell then you could say

Closes up on me
Opens my heart, tears it apart

It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall

The brighter sun and the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all","Queen"
"It's the fantastic drowse, of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears, the unending pleadings
To waste all your good times, In thoughts of your middle-aged years

For the everyday hero it all turns to zero, and there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young, and your troubles are all very small","Queen"

With endlessly restless feet, half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall, than we did in the school hall","Queen"

watching the night life the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door, always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy, It ain't easy at all
Thinking it right and doing it wrong, It's easier from an arm chair

Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood, Jimi Hendrix he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror, now who else do I like?","Queen"

Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love too see?
Oh jealousy look at me now, Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning, took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on, you couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How, how, how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy","Queen"

Life is much too short, to while away with tears

Keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end

Son of heaven set me free and let me go, Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand, Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes","Queen"

To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile

Beware the storm that gathers here, listen to the wise man

I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride, when life was just a game

Better sit back and go with the flow","Queen"

Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone for much too long

And it seems like there's no way out of this for me

Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah","Queen"
"Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all

"These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone cold, and he dont care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin out
Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again, he'd prolly knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, Do rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
Come on...","Aerosmith"

Sing with me, sing for the year

Sing with me, just for today

"Verse #2
Entertainment is changing, intertwine it with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Only you're unholy, only have one homey
Only this gun, lonely, cuz don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can be degreat, or even worse, they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you","Aerosmith"

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
don't get deep, shut up and dance
Love has got me down
a tear just hit the ground
so i started writing you this song
but the words i wrote came out all wrong
yeah, but its all right
When you can't define the crime
then life ain't worth a dime
when they take away everything you got
and rub your nose in the spot
not without a fight
when you work you fingers to the bone
now what does that get you -NOTHING
in a crowd of people
you're still alone
you hope that tells you somthing
the road to heaven is paved in hell
and it makes you wonder
why we're here at all
check out the shape of your circumstance
he wears the dress, she wears the pants
here comes Jill she needs romsance
but you cant do jack, so shut up
and dance!
Sex is like a gun
you aim, you shoot you run
when your splitting hairs with Mr. Clean
its like getting head from a guillotine
and the night has just begun

yeah I cant wait another day

"The streets were cold and barren
The nights were dark and dank
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....
The buildings were dead and the alleys
Stunk from things that used to live there
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence
With not a scrap left on the plate
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable
Cause the only thing left was their faith
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do
About it....","Aerosmith"

"So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold
Made me wonder just who was the foe
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus
Had predicted such a long long time ago?
You could hear screams and moanin'
From the people atoning
For their sins of a guilt ridden life
And the final door shuts
From the wind that leaves cuts
From the edge on the blade of God's knife
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....","Aerosmith"

You would run out of fools

How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had

The noticing 'twas connected to his head
How strange, not to believed

The butterflies flew up in such colors
Exploding all around us
The rest I did not notice 'til there he stood
All eyes in wonder
Who me
Who you

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he dont care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cuz he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
Come on...","Aerosmith"

Entertainment is changing, intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Only an unholy, only have one homie,
Only this gun, lonely cuz don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucka, they can be great
Or they can degrate, or even worse, they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you","Aerosmith"

And your feet flyin' up in the air,
I sing ""Hey diddle diddle""
Put your kitty in the middle of the swing

With a missy who was ready to play,
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way.
She told me to","Aerosmith"

didn't come back till the fourth of July

well well, silver bells, and little bitty bitty white shells

"As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya","Metallica"
"I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money yeah I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she treat me easy","Metallica"
"Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o","Metallica"
"Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels","Metallica"
"Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o","Metallica"
"Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like ta hear, ta hear cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain yeah","Metallica"
"Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o","Metallica"
"Whiskey in the jar-o
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da","Metallica"
